## 📖 Overview

**STUDY-BUDDY** is an all-in-one platform that helps students navigate their entire career journey: discovering the right career path, building a standout resume, preparing for interviews, finding opportunities, learning new skills, conducting research, and staying motivated — all in one place.

Built as a Flask monolith, it pairs **Google Gemini** (with automatic fallback to Groq and OpenRouter) with **classic retrieval (TF-IDF/BM25)** and large curated content banks (hundreds of interview questions, aptitude drills, DSA problems, and learning resources) so students get AI-powered guidance backed by real substance — not empty chat. Semantic embeddings via sentence-transformers are supported where installed; production currently uses the keyword/retrieval path.

### Why STUDY-BUDDY?

- **One profile, every tool** — resume, applications, practice scores, learning progress and research library all connected
- **Evidence over hype** — research answers carry citations, rejection advice is labeled as hypothesis, health scores show their data
- **Humane by design** — streaks with forgiveness shields, opt-out gamification, no pay-to-win, no dark patterns
- **Free & student-first** — every core feature works without payment

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/) (optional — core features work without it; AI-enhanced paths need it)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vivek492005/STUDY-BUDDY.git
cd STUDY-BUDDY

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | Flask session secret — set a long random value in production |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ⚠️ prod | PostgreSQL URL (Render provides this); falls back to local SQLite |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | optional | Enables Gemini-powered feedback, rewriting, and Q&A enhancements |

### Run

```bash
# Development
python unified_app.py

# Production (as deployed)
gunicorn unified_app:app
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** and create an account to get started.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -q
```

- **8720 tests**, covering every feature module: happy paths, validation, auth isolation, CSRF, rate limits, and error/edge cases
- Run the suite twice before any release; the project standard is **100% green, 0 failures**

---

## ☁️ Deployment

The live site runs on **Render's free tier**:

1. Connect the GitHub repo to Render as a **Web Service**
2. Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start command: `gunicorn unified_app:app`
4. Set `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` (Render Postgres), and `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the dashboard
5. Every push to `main` auto-deploys

| Resume parsing | Skill F1 | 1.00* |
| RAG retrieval | Recall@1 / MRR | 1.00* |
| RAG answers | Citation validity / Abstention | 1.00* |

\* *On synthetic gold sets. Real-world documents score lower — help us expand
the gold sets with challenging examples!*
