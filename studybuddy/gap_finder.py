"""Research-gap finder (Wave 4, #23) — pure logic for the study library.

Framework-free on purpose (no Flask imports), mirroring ``pdf_qa.py``: the
route layer in ``unified_app.py`` feeds it :class:`StudyDoc` /
:class:`PaperImport` rows (or duck-typed fakes in tests) and stores the
result dict as ``GapReport.data``.

Everything here is:

- **Deterministic** — same inputs always produce the same outputs. All
  ordering is by explicit sort keys (never set/dict iteration order), and
  ties break on ``(doc_id, chunk index)``.
- **Honest** — every gap carries verbatim evidence excerpts: each
  ``excerpt`` is a substring of the real chunk text it cites, so citation
  accuracy is verifiable with ``excerpt in chunk_text``. Suggested
  questions are template-based and never invent facts. When the
  collection is too thin to analyze, the report says so explicitly.
- **Defensive** — every public function tolerates ``None``, malformed
  entries, and empty inputs; none of them ever raises, and none of them
  touches the network (``suggest_next_papers`` reads only already-cached
  citation graphs).

``GapReport.data`` contract (this module owns the shape)::

    {
      "gaps": [
        {
          "title": str,                       # human-readable gap headline
          "type": "underexplored" | "conflict" | "single-paper",
          "evidence": [                       # >= 1 item, always
            {"doc": str, "page": int, "chunk": int,
